# Project 1  `#`

## Process for making Blog 

Started using the .md files, pretty simple, posting images and links.  

Using CSS was confusing at first, images and styles werent showing up.  So I used inspect and search to find the code for the given issue.  For example, adding the heading Scott Blog I just experimented placing a header inside index.njk.  Alot of this was trial and error.  

Getting the images to post, i had the images under the content folder.  In the eleventy config file there were instructions to put the images in public.  Same thing goes for the font.  

This was a cool project, I will continue to finesse the page, making images more orderly and ideally an intereactive comment box.
