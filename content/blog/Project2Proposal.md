# Project 2 `#`

## “The Earth is Breathing”

### concept

We will visualize the Earth as a living system by translating real environmental data into layered wave signals that behave like a pulse. Instead of presenting ocean and seismic data as numerical measurements, the site will reframe them as rhythms that reflect the planet’s constant movement between stability and disturbance.

## APIs used

[NOAA](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/data/realtime2/)

[USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/)

# Examples

Sasha Stiles had a wonderful computer generated art piece on a wall sized monitor that went into a database of text using different fonts and graphics. Worth checking out.
