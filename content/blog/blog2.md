### Learning about Eleventy, using MarkDown and nunjucks

I spent some time figuring out how to use the templatte to expand the blog.  My CSS changes didn't initally work.

I found using guides super helpful and easy to use.

I had an issue with eleventy finding my image files in the path.

In my last **web development class** we were actually encouraged to use AI tools to fix code, and were able to make much more complex product, I enjoyed going back to the grass roots style.  I feel like being able to switch gears and approaching things in different ways is really valuable.

I also used [eleventys guide](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/assets/)to figure out how to manipulate css.

Using a passthrough code to have eleventy access certain files was a bit of a snag for me. [This page](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/copy/) was helpful.
