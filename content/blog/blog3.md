I went to visit my parents for my Moms birthday. She's 82 now, so time now feels precious and limited. My parents have lived in the same house for 40 years, outside of Fort Worth.

Fort Worth is 45 miles west of Dallas, and much more country. Its also very MAGA forward.

It was nice to move slow.  I worked on some homework, this blog and also for my *fiction workshop 2 class*.  One of our assignments is to write a historical fiction piece with a given decade where the decade becomes like a third character.  I got 2020.  Im doing Vivian Wilson, Elon Musks trans daughter.
