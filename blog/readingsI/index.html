<p>When I glanced at the readings, I immediatly thought of an artist Trevor Paglan who has an MFA from Berkely and a PHD in Geography. He did a project where actually visited the telecommunications underwater. Below is a section of a text piece I saw in DC with a list of code names for different government activities, agencies, projects etc. I find it haunting.</p>

<p>&quot;fiber-optic cable surfaces, bringing information encoded in light waves&quot; creates an incredible global 'information highway', we don'f often think about. Curiously, and to Trevor Paglan's thought, the internet was started as a US Department of Defense Project in the 1960's, developed by Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). This became operational in 1969 to allow military and academics to share information securely and efficiently.</p>
<p>As the passage talks about both the displacement of Hawaii'ans and some disdain toward the cables as a form of colonialism. Conversely the Tahitians embrace it as a link to infomation and education. This irony exists on the US mainland as well; a trap of freedom if you will.</p>
<p>To think that fiber optic cables can carry more information at greater speeds than satellite is suprising and exciting. A signal from New York to London is 1/8th the speed of satellite, 28-30 milliseconds one way versus 250-600 milliseconds, but still.</p>

<h2 id="the-geopolitics-of-information-and-connection">The Geopolitics of information and connection</h2>
<p>How global political ties influence the network system and international communication is worth noting. <strong>North Koreas</strong> fiber optic cables come from China and Russia with global internet only allowed to a select elite and researchers, a few thousand people. Most citizens use only the domestic intranet (Kwangmyong).</p>
<p>The lack of infrastructure connected to state limitations for citizens seems to have a <strong><em>snowball effect</em></strong>. Eritrea is often cited as having the least internet access, including no mobile intenet access for most citizens. Long-standing U.S. sanctions against <strong>Cuba</strong> prevented telecom investment and undersea cable access there for decades. Similiarly in <strong>Iran</strong>, sanctions have restricted access to Western telecom equipment and finance.Being geographicaly landlocked aids the goverment of <strong>Turkmenistan's</strong> restriction of internet to its citizens.</p>
<p>Conversely, the countries with the fastest internet speeds are, <strong>loosely in order</strong>, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, France, Iceland, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, United States, South Korea, and honorable mentions, Sweden, Norway, Japan, and Taiwan. While considered the best intelligence agneices are United States, United Kingdom, China, Russia, and Israel. Paints an interesting global picture.</p>
<p>Undersea cables carry ~95%+ of global data traffic, and are vulnerable to interception and survellience. Large tech companies (Google, Amazon) now fund or own major undersea cables, shifting influence to private platforms.</p>
<h2 id="underwater-cables-and-the-environment">Underwater Cables and the environment</h2>
<p>Cable laying and burial can disturb natural ecosystems. In areas like the North Sea and the Mediterranean, cable burial disturbed benthic habitats by resuspending sediments that smother slow-growing corals and sponges, which recover very slowly.</p>
<p>Cables are designed to last 25 years but upgrades and repairs can vary due to friction, natural occurences and vulnerabilty in shallow placement.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Taiwan cable breaks, due to seabed earthquakes, damaged connections to Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and other parts of East Asia, causing widespread internet slowdowns and disruptions to financial and communication networks.</p>

<p>The 14th International Utility Locate Rodeo sounds like it would be an intersting thing to visit. I had no idea that &quot;telecommunications firms are legally obligated to make their cables easy for excavators to find&quot;, although I have spotted them on the streets and on the sides of buildings, as I walk alot. I actualy find these symbols fascinating.</p>
<p>This rodeo seems like a small compensation for a trade that pays so little, given its importance, kind of like paramedics and EMTs.</p>
<p>It makes sense that alot of professional locators and certifications became popular after 2000 with the expansion and popularity of the internet. “No one really understands how much stuff is in the ground,” the writer said she was told repeatedly by locators. Not even locaters even know. Makes you wonder if some of these are hidden on purpose.</p>
<p>I came across the Time Warner Cable logo and never realized that its the combination of an eye and an ear. Also kind of looks like the Egyptian heiroglyph Eye of Horus - very ominous.</p>
<p>The end of the article poses the idea of &quot;invisible&quot; things versus our active decision as individuals to ignore things. This reminded me of Milan Kunderas idea in &quot;The Art of the Novel&quot;, that describes society as a structure that sees things in black and white, and its our job (and the writers), to discover, to see the grey areas.</p>

<p>I found a map Burrington had made posted online, <strong>posted below</strong> showing the major data centers in lower Manhattan. One of those landmarks is 33 Thomas, said to be an NSA center, code name &quot;Titan Point&quot;. This brutalistic building makes me feel cozy somehow even though it has no windows.</p>
